# How to Use

## Creating a New Job
- Press Alt + N
- Select "Job App Template" or just press Enter
	- Type in your answers to the prompts
	- For the "Status" prompt, it would be best to select one of the suggested options.

## Changing Status
- Go to the note of the status you wish to change.
- Under the status header, if you go to edit the status you'll see something like 
```
(Status:: Applied)
```
- Only change the wording AFTER the ::
	- That's how the Hub page keeps track of the status of your application
- **NOTE**: If you do change, make sure you're being consistent with how you're spelling it. The hub tables group by status, so "Rejected" and "rejected" will show two different tables. I'm working on making this smoother, but it's tricky.
