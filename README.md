# How to Use

## Opening a new Obsidian Vault
- ### If you already have vaults in Obsidian:
	- In the lower left of the navigation menu, there should be the name of your current vault. Click it.
	- Then click "Manage Vaults"
	- A menu should open that looks like the menu when you first installed obsidian. 
	- Click "Open Folder As Vault"
	- Navigate to the root folder (Should be obsidian_job_tracker or something like that).
		- If you see the "scripts", "templates", "job_apps", etc. folders, you've gone down one level too far
	- Select that folder. Enjoy.
- ### If you have a fresh install of Obsidian
	- Launch obsidian
	- A menu should open
	- Click "Open Folder As Vault"
	- Navigate to the root folder (Should be obsidian_job_tracker or something like that).
		- If you see the "scripts", "templates", "job_apps", etc. folders, you've gone down one level too far
	- Select that folder. Enjoy.

## Creating a New Job
- Press Alt + N
- Select "Job App Template" or just press Enter
	- Type in your answers to the prompts
	- For the "Status" prompt, it would be best to select one of the suggested options.

## Changing Status
- Go to the note of the status you wish to change.
- Under the status header, if you go to edit the status you'll see something like 

```meta-bind
INPUT[suggester(option(Applied), option(Rejected), option(Ghosted), option(Offer Sent), option(Offer Accepted))]
```

- If you click the three lines, a menu will pop up that will let you choose an option.
- It's important to click one of these options and not type in your own, because the Hub page relies on this status for sorting
